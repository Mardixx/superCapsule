# Super Capsule

Super Capsule is the first platformer I've ever done with Unity.
This project done by following a tutorial is the one that helped me get in touch with the Unity interface.
It's a simple platformer with a title screen, coin collection, enemy squishing and scene management plus an end screen.

This file is the Unity build.
